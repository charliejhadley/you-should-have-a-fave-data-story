Data **storytelling** is about communicating. Data stories make dataviz meaningful and engaging.

I'll demonstrate what I mean by sharing **my** favourite data story - ["A Day in the Life of Americans" by Nathan Yau](https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/).

The actual data from the [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/questionnaires/tuquestionnaire.pdf) is too complicated to understand in its raw form.
<br>
<br>
This is why I **love** Nathan Yau's data visualisation. 
<br>
<br>
It transforms this complex, messy, human data into something we can begin to understand and explore.

This is my **2nd favourite** data story.
<br>
<br>
It's from an open-access paper on [food pairing in regional cuisines](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep00196).
<br>
<br>
It's very much the opposite of the first data story
@cr-flavour-pairing-network

::: {#cr-flavour-pairing-network .scale-to-fill}
![](flavour-pairing-network.png)
:::

Nathan Yau's "Day in the Life" was very much an enjoyable <em>choose your own adventure data story</em>.
<br>
<br>
This is very much a **difficult read** as bibliophiles might say. It's dense.

Lines between ingredients indicate they share flavour chemicals. 
<br>
<br>
Colour indicates ingredient type. 
<br>
<br>
Size indicates prelevance in the **56,000 recipes** studied in the paper it comes from.

That's fascinating! 
<br>
<br>
The [research paper investigates](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep00196) which regional cuisines prefer their recipes to contain similar or disimilar flavours!
<br>
<br>
I **love** that this has been studied and that this visualisation tries to bring all that information together.

But. There are big data quality issues here.
<br>
<br>
Are "brown rice" and "rice" definitely two distinct ingredients?
<br>
<br>
Liver comes in three types - beef, chicken and undefined?
[@cr-flavour-pairing-network]{pan-to="-80%,50%" scale-by="4"}

It's a little unusual to have such a flawed data story as my 2nd favourite.
<br>
But it has personal importance to me.
<br>
<br>
The data behind the chart was the first dataset I ever [(struggled to) read into R](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30016817/importing-and-analysing-non-rectangular-csv-files-in-r).
<br>
<br>
It's important when you choose your own favourite data stories that they resonate with you.[@cr-flavour-pairing-network]

Just before I help you find your own favourite chart - here's my 3rd favourite data story.
<br>
<br>
It's by [Caitlin Hudson](https://www.caitlinhudon.com/) and she first [shared it on Twitter back in 2020](https://x.com/beeonaposy/status/1215830967719485441).

I can't find any fault with this data story.
It's understated beauty.

However. The [maternity leave policies in the US are the worst amongst the world's richest countries](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/maternity-leave-us-policy-worst-worlds-richest-countries).
<br>
<br>
There are lots of faults to find with that.
