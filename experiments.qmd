Pan the image. [@cr-map]{pan-to="70%,-10%" scale-by="2.1"}

The width of this band indicates the size of the army at each place on the map.

Pan and zoom please. [@cr-map]{pan-to="-55%,10%" scale-by="1.5"}

And another pan and zoom. [@cr-map]{pan-to="-25%,10%" scale-by="1.5"}

As the graphic shows, the crossing of the Berezina River was a disaster, and the army finally struggled back into Poland with only 10,000 men remaining. [@cr-map]{pan-to="18%,-15%" scale-by="2.4"}

Also shown are the movements of auxiliary troops, as they sought to protect the rear and the flank of the advancing army.

Show the whole thing agian please: @cr-map

the size of the army,

its location on a two-dimensional surface,

direction of the army's movement,

and temperature on various dates during the retreat from Moscow.

It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.

The first is the classic of Charles Joseph Minard (1781-1870), the French engineer, which shows the terrible fate of Napoleon's army in Russia. Described by E. J. Marey as seeming to defy the pen of the historian by its brutal eloquence, 12 this combination of data map and time-series, drawn in 1869, portrays a sequence of devastating losses suffered in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812. @cr-map-2
