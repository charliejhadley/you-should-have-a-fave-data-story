Data **storytelling** is about communicating. Data stories make dataviz meaningful and engaging.

I'll demonstrate what I mean by sharing **my** favourite data story - ["A Day in the Life of Americans" by Nathan Yau](https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/).

Sit back and take in this 60 second clip of Nathan Yau's data story. While watching I want you to think about a few questions...

Let me take you through some of the comments I've heard people make about this data story. @cr-day-in-the-life-420

:monocle_face: Actually, how sure are we that this is **exactly** what people are doing at 4:20pm?<br><br>Who are these people?<br><br>Where is the data from?[@cr-day-in-the-life-420]

:exploding_head: This data visualisation **doesn't** contain exactly what people are doing minute by minute.[@cr-day-in-the-life-420]{pan-to="150%,-160%" scale-by="4"}

The actual data from the [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/questionnaires/tuquestionnaire.pdf) is too complicated to understand in its raw form.
<br>
<br>
This is why I **love** Nathan Yau's data visualisation. 
<br>
<br>
It transforms this complex, messy, human data into something we can begin to understand and explore.
